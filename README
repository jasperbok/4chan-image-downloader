                                  What is it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Python application that runs from a commandline interface that downloads all
the images from a specific image board thread for you.

It's easily extendible to use for other message boards. See the 'Extending'
section in this readme to see how that works.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                 Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Python 2.7 (other Python versions might work, but this is the one I used to
  create and test the program).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  How to Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply place whole program somewhere and navigate to the chosen location from
your commandline. From there, start the program using the command
'python download_images.py'. From there on, the application explains itself.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  Extending
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can extend the application by writing a small class that represents the
image board you want to download from.

I'll write a better guide later on, but for now you can copy the 
FourChanDownloader.py from the downloaders folder and edit (and rename) that
one to your needs.
