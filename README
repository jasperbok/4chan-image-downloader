                                  What is it?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Python application that runs from a commandline interface that downloads all
the images from a specific image board thread for you.

It's easily extendible to use for other message boards. See the 'Extending'
section in this readme to see how that works.

                                 Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Python 2.7 (other Python versions might work, but this is the one I used to
  create and test the program).
- wget -- This is availble on most (all?) Linux distributions. I don't know
  about the availability for OS X or Windows (though I guess OS X ships it
  by default as well).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  How to Use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Simply place whole program somewhere and navigate to the chosen location from
your commandline. From there, start the program using the command
'python download_images.py'. From there on, the application explains itself.
